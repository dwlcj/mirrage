## Mirrage

Mirrage (Mirrage Indirect Radiance Renderer And Game Engine) is a Vulkan based deferred renderer with bits and pieces of a simple game engine, that has been developed as part of my CS Bachelor thesis about screen-space global illumination. As such it is (at least in its current state) mostly just a fancy renderer with a simple demo application and just enough engine stuff (ECS, input, ui, glue-code) to keep that running. But in the future I will hopefully get it to an actually usefull state and use it as a basis for my future projects.
